# Study web graphic

I want to implement a feature similar to [blur.me](https://blur.me), so I created this project to explore and research the canvas and WebGL tech stack. this timeline I've committed to completing my research is 2025/03/16.
If you happen to stop by and see that I'm heading in the wrong direction, please help me out.
